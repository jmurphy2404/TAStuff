    Create a string variable called test and give it a value of your name
    Create another variable called myAge and give it a value of your age
    Add those two together and see what happens! Do you get a string or a number back? How about if we add a number and a boolean?
    What data type could be used to store both name and age in one variable?

let test = "John Murphy"

let myAge = 28
